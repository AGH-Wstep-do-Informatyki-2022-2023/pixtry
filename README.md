<summary>Prologue</summary>
<p>

Derek Williams is a chronic criminal who spent his 20 years in prison. One day a group of scientists offers him to undergo psychological experiment on the condition that he gets what he wants. So Derek agreed and went to the experiment. But the true purpose of the experiment was not only psychological.

<p>

In fact Derek is a psychopath which means he doesn’t have any regular human emotions like sympathize or love someone else. He doesn’t even know about this kind of expression. So that’s why scientists chose him and tricked him into the artificial brain chip experiment.  The goal of the experiment is to install those kinds of emotions to his brain and change his behavior.

And just after they installed it, Derek instantly went to the coma and his destiny is on the player's hand.

## Game tone and coloring

The goal for us is to create kind of *horror* game. It is kept mostly in dark colors (to keep right vibe). Simple 2D game with some interesting mechanics. **Stay tuned for updates**
