<summary>Prologue</summary>
<p>

One day a group of scientists offers Derek to undergo psychological experiment on the condition that he gets what he wants. So Derek agreed and went to the experiment. But the true purpose of the experiment was not only psychological.

<p>

In fact Derek is a psychopath which means he doesn’t have any regular human emotions like sympathize or love someone else. He doesn’t even know about this kind of expression. So that’s why scientists chose him and tricked him into the artificial brain chip experiment.  The goal of the experiment is to install those kinds of emotions to his brain and change his behavior.

After the chip was installed, Derek wakes up in a room with hospital equipment and he doesn’t know anything about where he is. He only knows he has to get out of this place.  So Derek starts exploring the mysterious place. In the early part of the story the place looks like a some kind of orphanage  where he meets a young boy. When he meets the boy, strange creatures start chasing them and the boy saves Derek. When Derek asks the boy where they are and who he is, the boy gets angry and leaves him at the place and says “I cannot help you even if you don’t know me. You  don’t even know nothing about yourself. So you have to find the way out by yourself or remember me and come back to me”. Then the boy ran and disappeared.
